# Reporting for Web Forms - Manual Client-Side Library Registration

You can register client-side libraries automatically using the following settings in the `Web.config` file `resources` section:

```xml
<devExpress>
    <!-- ... -->
    <resources>
        <add type="ThirdParty" />
        <add type="DevExtreme" />
    </resources>
</devExpress>
```
For more information, review the following help topic: [External Client Libraries](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/17153/common-concepts/webconfig-modifications/webconfig-options/external-client-libraries).

Sometimes you need to have more control over the libraries your application loads. If that is important to you, you'll need to add client libraries manually and in a specific order.
In this example, all the required third-party and DevExtreme libraries are registered in an ASP.NET Web Forms application manually, one by one. 

To disable automatic registration, leave the `resources` section empty in the `Web.config` file:

```xml
<devExpress>
    <!-- ... -->
    <resources>
    </resources>
</devExpress>
```
You must then register the client scripts manually.

## Implementation Details

In this example, client libraries and stylesheets are included in the [Default.aspx](./CS/T115434/Default.aspx). 

> [!NOTE]
> The order in which the libraries are loaded onto the page is important. 

### Third-Party Libraries

#### Required Libraries
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Knockout](https://knockoutjs.com/)

#### Optional Libraries

- [Ace.js](http://ace.c9.io/)Â - used by the [Expression Editor](https://devexpress.github.io/dotnet-eud/reporting-for-web/articles/report-designer/report-designer-tools/expression-editor.html) in the [Web Report Designer]().
- [DevExpress Rich Text Editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devexpress-richedit) - enables you to edit rich text in the [XRRichText](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRRichText) control at design time.


### DevExtreme Library

[DevExtreme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devextreme/)Â library is required since Reporting for Web components are based on DevExtreme widgets.

## How to Run the Example

1. This example uses the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager to download library files. Right-click the `package.json` file in the *Solution Explorer*, and select *Restore Packages* to load libraries from **npm** source. You can also use the `npm install` command in the project folder to restore packages.

2. Run the project in Visual Studio. You can open the [Default.aspx](http://localhost:23542/Default.aspx) page that includes styles and libraries in the necessary order, or load the [DefaultWithBundles.aspx](http://localhost:23542/DefaultWithBundles.aspx) page that includes scripts bundled with the [BuildBundlerMinifier](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BuildBundlerMinifier).
